nuc_retro_rules_bngl
====================

BNGL's for the nucleosome regulation effect in retroactivity project

There are three main kinds of BNGL file 5nuc_tri*.bngl, 5nuc_di*.bngl
and MM*.bngl. the first two stand for files where nucleosome influence in transcription regulation
is important. the third is a control where transcription is guidede solely by a Michaelis
enten reaction and autoregulation.
